# Clustering 1990 U.S. Census Data
DBSCAN Clustering U.S. Census Data project for CS 4710 Data Mining

### Date created
April 17, 2018

### Description
This is a class project, done for CS 4710 Data Mining. I wrote a program to cluster U.S. Census data by implementing the DBSCAN algorithm in Java. I found this difficult to do and I also did not draw any conclusions with data analysis afterwards.

I do not think that DBSCAN is a good algorithm for this data set. I believe that a better way to analyze this data would be to explore this data using Python with NumPy and Pandas and draw conclusions based on that exploration.
